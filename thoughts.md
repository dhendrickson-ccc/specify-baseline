## Potential Workflow
1. Push spec, plan, taks, etc to branch. 
2. Create new branch off of that to begin implementation
3. In the event that you don't like what you're getting mod your plan or whatever then create a new branch and start fresh. 

## If you're working on stuff with a UI
1. Figure out how to provide a style guide
2. Provide a template for the AI to reference if possible. 
3. Tell it to request visual confirmation before declaring that the code is done and working.
